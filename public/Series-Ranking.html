<h1>The Best Series According to Oli </h1>
<h2>My top 5 series of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Boys</h3>
<p>I like the superhero theme but with a realist perspective on the world.</p>
<h3>The Sporanos</h3>
<p>Cool Mafia drama, very ahead of its time</p>

<h3>Vikings</h3>
<p>My favourite era of history.</p>

<h3>Stranger things</h3>
<p>Very good SCI-FI storyline.</p>

<h3>Halo</h3>
<p>played the game as a kid so it was good to see it made into a series.</p>
